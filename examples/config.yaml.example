# Strategy:
#   Wallpaper sources normally offer different sizes of a picture for different screen resolutions. The strategy
# is a hint for the fittest picture.
#   Currently following values can be used as strategy:
#     *  largest-no-logo: the largest watermark-free version of picture, meaningful to Bing channel only, other channels
#        don't add watermark to images
#     *  largest: always use the highest resolution
#     *  by-width: specify the width of image explicitly, must be used with a "width" option. the height of picture is
#        calculated automatically to retain the ratio of image

# path and basename of downloaded wallpaper file. Do NOT include extension name
# in this setting for which is automatically decided by channels

# The active-channels is a list containing keys of enabled channel definitions.
# Items can either be plain string names which enable corresponding channels
# in every refreshing executions or name-probability maps (map[string]float)
# which enable the corresponding channel subjected to the specified probability.
# The probability should be in range of [0, 1] which stands for never and always
# respectively.
# 
# Using probabilities less <1.0 is recommended for those channel types which always
# return a new photo (e.g. unsplash) at every request so that other channels
# following it can get a chance to run.
#
# Probability of the last active channel in this list will always be considered
# as 1 to guarantee at least one detection in each refreshing, hence its user
# setting will be ignored.
