# Strategy:
#   Wallpaper sources normally offer different sizes of a picture for different screen resolutions. The strategy
# is a hint for the fittest picture.
#   Currently following values can be used as strategy:
#     *  largest-no-logo: the largest watermark-free version of picture, meaningful to Bing channel only, other channels
#        don't add watermark to images
#     *  largest: always use highest resolution
#     *  by-width: specify the width of image explicitly, must be used with a "width" option. the height of picture is
#        calculated automatically to retain the ratio of image

# The active-channels is a list containing keys of enabled channel definitions
# an item can either be plain string name which enables a channel in all refreshing
# or a name-probability (string-float) map which enables the corresponding
# channel subjected to specified probability. The probability should be in range
# of [0, 1] which stands for never and always respectively.
# A probability less than one can be used on those channel types which is always
# able to return a new photo (e.g. unsplash) so that other channels following it
# get a chance to run
# Probability of the last active channel in this list will always be considered
# as 1 to guarantee at least one detection, hence its user setting will be ignored.
